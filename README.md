# Jan Szczekulski's personal website
You can find a live version at [jan-cs.com](http://jan-cs.com/).


## Requirements
* node - v20.5.0
* npm - 9.8.0

## Dependencies installation
* install dependencies - `npm config set legacy-peer-deps true && npm i && npm install node-sass@latest && npm update && npm install` (can skip `npm update`)
* install gatsby cli - `npm install -g gatsby-cli`
* install lintering - `npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-prettier`

## Running website locally and debugging
* `npm run develop` - start off your website quickly (eg. without compiling)
* `gatsby build` - build your code (eg. compile your code into public folder)
* `gatsby serve` - serve your built code
* `gatsby clean` - remove your built code (eg. the one from /public folder)
* `npm linter` - linter your repo 

## Coding in this repo
* You should utilize already existing designs created for [material-ui](https://mui.com/material-ui/icons/)
* The public folder is autogenerated (therefore better to ignore it within git), yet for CV re-direct (look `href="/resume.pdf"`) code snippet to work, the resume.pdf has to be in `/public` folder.
* Therefore my own command to built for deployment: `gatsby clean && gatsby build && cp src/assets/resume.pdf public/.`
