# Jan Szczekulski's personal website
You can find a live version at [jan-cs.com](http://jan-cs.com/).


## Running website locally and debugging
* install dependencies - `npm config set legacy-peer-deps true && npm i && npm install node-sass@latest && npm update && npm install` # This worked for me, I know commands are repeating, same should be achievable via just running `npm update`
* build - `gatsby build`
* start" - `npm run develop`
* serve - `gatsby serve`
* clean - `gatsby clean`

## Frameworks and packages used
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) (Based on [React](https://reactjs.org/))
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [react-tsparticles](https://github.com/matteobruni/tsparticles)
- [react-vertical-timeline-component](https://github.com/stephane-monnot/react-vertical-timeline)
- ... and more!

## Coding in this repo
* You should utilize already existing designs created for [material-ui](https://mui.com/material-ui/icons/)
* I assume public folder is autogenerated (therefore better to ignore in git), yet for CV re-direct (look `href="/resume.pdf"` code snippet) to work, it has to be in /public folder. Could be automated, for now I move it manually when I update my CV
