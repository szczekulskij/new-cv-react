**Hi there!**

I'm Jan Szczekulski, a Full-Stack SDE and data scientist. I'm currentely pursuing my masters in CSE (AI specialization) @UCSD, where I'm working in CRI lab on home robot project. I'm also collaborating with Lazarski University on AI applications in Medicine. Off the keyboard, I'm perfecting my basketball dribble and immersing myself in reads. Feel free to reach out to me or explore my work below!
