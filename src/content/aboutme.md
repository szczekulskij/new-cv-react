**Hey!**

I'm Jan Szczekulski from Poland!  
I love programming, toying with data as well as basketball and learning new cs-related knowledge
I've had a chance to work as a data scientist, full stack engineer as well as an AI researcher.
Feel free to get in touch or take a look at my past work below.
