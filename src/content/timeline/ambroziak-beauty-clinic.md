Our research of long-term treatment of PWS birthmarks revealed that discontinuation of treatment leads to a worsening of the condition. Consequently, this lead to introduction of a novel sustained treatment for PWS. Right now I'm working on using imaging methods such as GANs and CNNs to estimate the effectiveness of the treatment (in the form of a numerical value or a post-treatment image).

Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, Numpy, scikit-learn)
