In October 2019, I started to develop a small battleships online multiplayer game for my school class. Two months later, that game is now [available to play](https://battleships.diogotc.com)! And it's open source, so feel free to take a look at the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/diogotcorreia/battleship-js).
