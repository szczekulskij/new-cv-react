After 6 months of work, everything was ready for [Craftathon 2017](https://2017.craftathon.org/)! I joined other developers to create an amazing charity event in Minecraft, which was able to raise _\$6,455.23_ for [Child's Play Charity](https://childsplaycharity.org/), improving the lives of children in domestic violence shelters and hospitals! I mainly worked on the website back-end, mostly on the payment system.
