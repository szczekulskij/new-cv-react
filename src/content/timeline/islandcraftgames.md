After a few months of work, I've managed to create a Minecraft server with custom plugins! We also had a website with PayPal support to allow for donations, all custom made. The server was closed later that year, so I've decided to [open source most of the code](https://bitbucket.org/account/user/islandcraftgames/projects/ICG).
