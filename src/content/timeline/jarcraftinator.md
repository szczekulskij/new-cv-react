After Craftathon ended, I didn't have anything to do, so I made myself a challenge: create a [fully working Minecraft server software from scratch](https://github.com/Clout-Team/JarCraftinator).  
**The goal?** Learn more about how socket connections work in Java. And after a week I got my first loaded chunk! The project is far from finished and it will probably stay that way, but it was fun to do nonetheless.
