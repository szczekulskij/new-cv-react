I designed a website for [Portugal Ultra Triathlon](https://web.archive.org/web/20191113224253/https://www.portugalultratriathlon.com/), an _«Adventure for Charity»_ and a triple ironman triathlon.
Portugal Ultra Triathlon is a solidary adventure and a triple ironman. Its mission is to challenge participants' limits and their resilience, generate social value and supporting local communities.  
I was behind the entire internet presence of the event, from the website itself down to the donation system and sysadmin work (setting up emails, custom domains, etc).
