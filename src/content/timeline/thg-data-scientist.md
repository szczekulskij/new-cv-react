During my time as a data scientist at THG, I've worked on tools surrounding internal A/B testing. Such as automated query generations, ad-hoc data analyses of A/B tests, automatic generation of results. The a/b tests I've conducted saved/earned company estimated Â£3 million per year. I assisted in the creation of a Machine Learning algorithm aimed at predicting short-term demand. At last, I've worked on pipelines setup, including shell scripts, Jenkins, VM and GH actions setups.
