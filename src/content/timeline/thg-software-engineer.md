I led the `experimentable widgets` project, which enabled the company to quickly and dynamically test changes to website's frontend utilizing A/B testing. As part of this project, I've made alterations to the larger internal architecture, including 4 backends and 2 frontends. As of time of writing, this feature enabled 15 new A/B tests in only 2 months, all set up effortlessly via UI. The estimated earning/savings of these A/B tests were Â£7 million per year.
