[TreeTree2](https://treetree2.school/) is a non-profit that helps young children up to 12th grade to go beyond school and
learn new and interesting topics!
I've participated in 3 editions of "Inform√°tica I", their course that is dedicated to teaching Python, as well
as 1 edition of "Web I", which teaches how the internet works, HTML/CSS and a bit of JavaScript.
