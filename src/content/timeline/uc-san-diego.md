During my masters I'm primarly focusing on Deep RL and Computer Vision, while also learning more about all the other AI subfields such as NLP or Reccommendation Systems. I'm also a GSR at the [Contextual Robotics Institute](https://contextualrobotics.ucsd.edu/) where I'm working on a home robot project.
