During the process of writing my thesis, I implemented a DDPG (Reinforcement Learning) algorithm using PyTorch improving it by (then) recent breakthroughs in AI, such as Stochastic Weighted Averaging (SWA) and One-Cycle Policy. This lead to a more successful convergence and stability of DDPG, which is most often difficult.
