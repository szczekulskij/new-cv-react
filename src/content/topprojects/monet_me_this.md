I implemented a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Artificial Intelligence (AI) system which can turn any photograph into a painting that closely resembles the style of the master painter, Monet. Additionally, I developed and launched a full-stack web application game where players must determine which images were generated by Monet and which by the AI.
